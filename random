SSH Connection. 
When ssh trust connection is established between 2 machines, 
there is a ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file that stores a copy of other machine's public ssh ID. 
Each line in the file is an entry for one user from another machine for non-prompt access. 
Each line by default ends with the format "username@hostname_of_machine". This last part is a comment. Removing the comment still makes the
SSH trust entry a valid entry. You can repurpose the comment content in case you are manipulating/managing SSH keys.
